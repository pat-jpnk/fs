how to build

build as static (.a)

"runConfigureICU Linux --enable-static --disable-shared"

in icu4c/source

OR "~/Downloads/icu-release-69-1/icu4c-build$ bash ../icu4c/source/runConfigureICU Linux "

"""

Out-of-source build: It is usually desirable to keep the ICU source file tree clean and have build output files written to a different location. This is called an "out-of-source build". Simply invoke the configure script from the target location:
~/icu$ git clone export https://github.com/unicode-org/icu.git
~/icu$ mkdir icu4c-build
~/icu$ cd icu4c-build
~/icu/icu4c-build$ ../icu/icu4c/source/runConfigureICU Linux
~/icu/icu4c-build$ make check

(Note: this example shows a relative path to runConfigureICU. If you experience difficulty, try using an absolute path to runConfigureICU instead.)
